Some simple Python kata solutions. 

For each problem I have included inline testing.

### fizzbuzz.py

The object of fizzbuzz is to ensure that for each number entered one of the three responses is returned. 

* 'fizz' if the number is divisible by 3
* 'buzz' if the number is divisible by 5
* 'fizzbuzz' if the number is divisible both 3 and 5
